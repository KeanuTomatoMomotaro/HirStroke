# HirStroke
Japanese Hiaragana Stroke Order Language Learning Web Application

In conjunction with my final year dissertation at [UNMC](https://www.nottingham.edu.my/index.aspx) on e-learning gamification.
This application was a pure php implementation of a language learning application to help beginners learn, practice, and memorize basic Hiragana stroke orders.


## how to view

1. clone the project and put it on a web server or a local web server like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
2. On your browser, navigate to 
```
localhost:/HirStroke/Code/index.php
```
Alternatively, navigate to 
```
localhost:/nameOfYourClonedFolder/Code/index.php
```
## Improvement Checklists
I've yet to modify it since my time back in UNMC, but from what I recall, some things that my dissertation examiner thought should be fixed includes:
 
- [ ] Make a progress bar to "really" gamify the platform
- [ ] Counter to count mistakes the user did on practice modes
- [ ] use a library
